Tail Recursion:
In Scala tail recursions are used to iterate and achieve certain functinality rather than loops keeping in mind performance
and is a well recommended method.

This code tries to demonstrate how Tail Recursion which is a fundamental features of scala programming can be used to achieve
the following functionality:
  - Reverse a list of elements of any type or a generic list
  - Count the frequnecy of characters and print along side of the character (ignoring count of single characters).
    Ex: AAAAAABBBCCD -> 5A3B2CD
